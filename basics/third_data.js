// variable declare same as python

"use strict" // treat all js code with new version or new standard


// alert("hello") // we are using node js not browser this is done only in browser we can use this in different way in node js
let name = "kushagra" //string
let age =22 //integer (range 2^53)
// We can use bigint data type for larger range mostly used in stock market website

let isLoggedIn=true //boolean
let temp=null // 0 is a temperature but when website is not able to fetch any temp then how can we find that 
//null =>stand alone value 
//undefined =>when value is not assigned to variable 

//symbol (mainly used when we learn about react to indetify component is unique ,figma tools  )=?unique

//typeof to find the data type
console.log(typeof(null)) // null is object type
console.log(typeof(undefined)) // undefined is already a type
console.log(typeof(age))
